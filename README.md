# The Letter — Cinematic Interactive Experience

A production-ready static web experience that delivers a premium, emotionally-driven love-letter ritual:

- Anticipation intro with paced loading transition
- Tactile wax-seal drag interaction to open the envelope
- Cinematic envelope-to-letter reveal sequence
- Ink-style paragraph reveal pacing with synchronized micro-audio
- Environment transition from golden light to night stars
- Closing ritual that folds the letter and fades to a final message
